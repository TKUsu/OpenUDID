    !!! IMPORTANT !!!

    IF YOU ARE GOING TO INTEGRATE OpenUDID INSIDE A (STATIC) LIBRARY,
    PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU REFACTOR THE OpenUDID CLASS WITH A PREFIX OF YOUR OWN,
    E.G. ACME_OpenUDID. THIS WILL AVOID CONFUSION BY DEVELOPERS WHO ARE ALSO
    USING OpenUDID IN THEIR OWN CODE.

    !!! IMPORTANT !!!
